This is a interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
HTML, JavaScript, Plotly was used to create this dashboard.
You will be able to hover over the horizontal bar chart, or bubble chart to observe how much bacteria is on the subject. You can also click on the test subject id to change which subject is being examed.
